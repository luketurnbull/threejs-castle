# Castle on a Hill

Castle Project for ThreeJS Journey Challenge 18

# TODO/ Ideas list

## Styling buttons

There are three buttons:

- Start
- Audio
- Day/Night Mode

I want to make the buttons look more castle themed.
I want to use the same style for all three buttons.

GSAP MorphSVG to morph the moon and sun SVGs in the mode toggle, and also change the mood of the buttons depending on the mode. Maybe orange and yellow for day, and blue and purple for night.

I would like when the audio button is clicked, the sound icon should animate to show it's on with musical notes.

I would like to add sounds and cool hover effect/ click effect to the buttons.

## Compressing images / Performance optimizations

Possible make all images half the size and see if it improves the performance. And then BASIS compress them:

Potentially do adaptive performance? Less grass blades and no clouds if the users computer can't handle it?

## Post processing

If the smaller images work, I would like to add some post processing effects.

# Audio

Different audio for day and night.

Audio for fire, when the camera is close to the fire, make it louder.
