# Castle on a Hill

Castle Project for ThreeJS Journey Challenge 18

# TODO/ Ideas list

## Loading screen and background sounds

- [x] Add basic loading screen and background sound
- [ ] Think of loading screen concept that fits with concept/ colours themes, svg pictures?
- [ ] Add way to toggle audio off

## Castle

- [ ] Way less emissions coming from windows in Blender, looks too orange

## Grass

- [x] Make grass strands different heights
- [ ] Fade grass sound out when users mouse leaves the hill
- [ ] Make hover over grass effect better

## Windows

- [x] Make windows all an instance mesh so we're using the same mesh and material
- [x] Make sure window normals are facing the correct way in Blender so we don't have to use THREE.DoubleSide
- [x] Add cool shader to the mesh, that looks like a flickering light

## Rocks

- [ ] Add a bunch of rocks to the scene in Blender and rebake everything

## Tree

- [ ] Come up with a concept for a tree

## Flag

- [ ] Add waving flag to the top of the castle

## Night mode

- [ ] Bake lighting for night time (moon light and more emission from castle windows?)
- [ ] Dim down the ambient light in the scene
- [ ] Change the Sun settings
- [ ] Show a moon in the Sky some how?
