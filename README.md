# Castle on a Hill

Castle Project for ThreeJS Journey Challenge 18

# TODO/ Ideas list

## Debug UI

- [ ] Add Leva UI to debug things

## Grass

- [x] Make grass strands different heights
- [ ] Fade grass sound out when users mouse leaves the hill
- [ ] Make hover over grass effect better

## Windows

- [x] Make windows all an instance mesh so we're using the same mesh and material

## Tree

- [ ] Come up with a concept for a tree

## Rocks

- [ ] Add a bunch of rocks to the scene in Blender and rebake everything

## Night mode

- [ ] Bake lighting for night time (moon light and more emission from castle windows?)
- [ ] Dim down the ambient light in the scene
- [ ] Show a moon in the Sky some how?

## Flag
