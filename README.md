# Castle on a Hill

Castle Project for ThreeJS Journey Challenge 18

# TODO

## Grass

- [x] Make grass strands different heights

## Windows

- [ ] Make sure window normals are facing the correct way in Blender so we don't have to use THREE.DoubleSide
- [ ] Make windows all an instance mesh so we're using the same mesh and material

## Tree

- [ ] Come up with a concept for a tree

## Night mode

- [ ] Bake lighting for night time (moon light and more emission from castle windows?)
- [ ] Dim down the ambient light in the scene
- [ ] Show a moon in the Sky some how?

## Flag

- [ ] Add waving flag to the top of the castle
